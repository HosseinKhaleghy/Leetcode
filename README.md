# Leetcode
Description:
This repository is dedicated to storing my solutions to various LeetCode coding problems. LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. By sharing my solutions here, I aim to:

Document My Progress: Track my journey of solving coding challenges on LeetCode and measure my progress over time.

Share Knowledge: Provide a resource for others who are working on similar problems or seeking insights into different problem-solving approaches.

Demonstrate Problem Solving: Showcase my problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and creativity in finding efficient solutions to algorithmic challenges.

Learn and Collaborate: Encourage collaboration and feedback from the programming community to improve my solutions and learn from others.

Folder Structure:

Each problem solution is organized into its own folder with a descriptive name.
Within each folder, you can find the source code in Python language and a , my approach, and any relevant insights.
Contribution:
If you have suggestions for improving any of my solutions, please feel free to create a pull request or open an issue. I'm always open to learning from others and enhancing the quality of this repository.

Disclaimer:
The solutions in this repository are meant for educational purposes and are not intended to provide a means of cheating on LeetCode or other coding platforms. I encourage all users to respect the rules and guidelines of such platforms and use this repository responsibly.
